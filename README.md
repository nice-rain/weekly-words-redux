# Weekly Words

## Summary
This is the react-redux front-end of the Weekly Words application. It allows a user to register, login, retrieve, and review decks generated by the Weekly Words back-end. The purpose is to allow a user to learn 20 new words/phrases each week. The back-end will generate a flash card deck each week with 20 words and definitions. As the user reviews the deck, the total time and accuracy are recorded. This allows the user to track their review progress each week.

:exclamation: You will need to have setup and installed the node.js back-end in order to run the application successfully.<br>
